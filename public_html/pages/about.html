			<b>The Amerasian Research Network, Ltd. (ARN, Ltd.)</b> is an independent, non-profit, charitable human research group organized under the tax exempt provisions of Sect. 501 [C] 3 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. It is dedicated to academic research, scholarly inquiry, and the widest dissemination of evidence-based empirical and fact-based information on military Philippine Amerasian, Pan Amerasian and Pacific Island Amerasian populations in the Western Pacific Rim. The Amerasian Foundation defines an Amerasian as any person who was fathered by a citizen of the United States (a US American serviceman, expatriate, or US government employee, or [private sector] military contractor), and whose mother is or was an Asian or Pacific Islander national. Specifically, the ARN, Ltd. focuses on issues of human welfare, health and rights of those Amerasians who remain in their country of birth and were abandoned, stranded, estranged, orphaned and/or left unsupported by U.S. American fathers. Originally formed in 2011 in New York State as the National Amerasian Research Institute [Provisional] as an unincorporated entity, the ARN, Ltd. is a non-profit agency authorized under Section 402 of the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law (NPCL) and registered with the Office of the NY Department of State, Albany, New York. (May 15, 2012 — date of NYSNPCL Certification).
